### Web Components
Web Components are a set of features currently being added by the W3C to the HTML and DOM specifications that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications. The intention behind them is to bring component-based software engineering to the World Wide Web. The components model allows for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements.
